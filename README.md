Signal Processing Development and Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio for Signal Processing Development and Testing Services.

I provide scalable Python-based platforms for signal processing applications, with emphasis on Test-Driven Development (TDD) frameworks and long-term support.

## What This Repository Contains

1. **Portfolio Website** (`docs/index.html`) - Professional showcase of my services and capabilities
2. **Working Demonstration** (`signal_processing/`) - A production-ready spatial audio processing framework that demonstrates the quality and depth of platforms I build for clients
3. **Technical Documentation** (`AGENT.md`) - Comprehensive development notes and architecture details

## Services I Provide

- **Custom Python Infrastructure** - Scalable platforms tailored for signal processing applications
- **TDD Framework Development** - Comprehensive testing frameworks that ensure code quality and accelerate development
- **Long-Term Platform Support** - Ongoing maintenance, updates, and knowledge transfer
- **Real-Time Processing Systems** - Production-ready audio processing with live streaming capabilities
- **Spatial Audio Solutions** - HRTF-based binaural rendering and 3D audio systems

## Portfolio Demonstration

The `signal_processing/` directory contains a complete, working spatial audio framework that demonstrates:
- Real-time 3D audio processing with HRTF-based binaural rendering
- Modular architecture with 100+ tests and CI/CD integration
- Professional development practices (TDD, type hints, pre-commit hooks)
- Multiple deployment patterns (file-based processing and real-time streaming)

This serves as proof of the quality and depth of platforms I build for clients.

For technical details about the signal processing framework, see `signal_processing/README.md`.
