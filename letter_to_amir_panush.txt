Dear Mr. Amir Panush,

I am writing to you regarding CEVA's audio department, which I understand has been closed. I would like to propose a discussion about reopening this department with a modern, scalable approach that could position CEVA at the forefront of audio signal processing technology.

My name is Noam Shabtai, and I provide professional Python-based signal processing development and testing services. I specialize in delivering scalable platforms with Test-Driven Development (TDD) frameworks and long-term support - the foundation that modern audio departments need to succeed.

DEMONSTRATION OF CAPABILITIES

To demonstrate the quality and depth of services I provide, I have built a production-ready spatial audio processing system as a portfolio example. This system includes:

• Real-Time 3D Audio Processing: HRTF-based binaural rendering with quaternion-based head orientation tracking, enabling immersive spatial audio experiences

• Modular Architecture: A Python monorepo with separate packages for STFT processing, spatial audio, buffer management, and activation patterns - designed for scalability and maintainability

• Live GUI Demo: A real-time Tkinter-based interface demonstrating azimuth/elevation control and per-channel gain management

• Comprehensive Testing: 100+ tests across all modules using pytest with YAML-based parametrization, ensuring reliability and making future development safe and predictable

• Modern Development Practices: CI/CD with GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, type hints throughout, and automatic testing on all pull requests

The complete source code and technical documentation are publicly available at:

A live demonstration of my capabilities is hosted at:

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CEVA

The audio processing industry is evolving rapidly. Modern platforms require:

1. Rapid Development and Testing: TDD frameworks enable faster iteration and reduce bugs in production

2. Scalability: Modular Python architecture allows teams to work on different components simultaneously without conflicts

3. Long-term Maintainability: Well-tested, documented code reduces technical debt and onboarding time for new team members

4. Real-time Capabilities: My framework demonstrates processing with PyAudio integration, suitable for production audio applications

SERVICES I OFFER

I would like to discuss how my professional services could help reopen CEVA's audio department with a modern, scalable foundation:

• Custom Python Infrastructure: Building scalable platforms tailored for audio signal processing applications
• TDD Framework Development: Establishing comprehensive testing frameworks that ensure code quality and accelerate development cycles
• Long-Term Platform Support: Providing ongoing maintenance, updates, and knowledge transfer to your team
• Domain Expertise: Leveraging proven experience with spatial audio, real-time processing, and production-ready systems

My portfolio demonstrates that sophisticated audio processing platforms can be built efficiently with modern tools and practices. I provide the services and expertise to make this a reality for CEVA.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my services can support CEVA in reopening the audio department. I am confident that with the right scalable infrastructure and development approach, we can build something exceptional that positions CEVA as a leader in audio technology.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
