# Signal Processing Development & Testing Services

Building Scalable Python Platforms with TDD Frameworks and Long-Term Support

---

## About

I provide professional Python-based development and testing services for signal processing applications. My expertise lies in building scalable platforms with comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) frameworks and providing long-term support that ensures your systems remain maintainable and reliable.

I help organizations transform their signal processing algorithms into production-ready, scalable platforms with robust testing infrastructure and modern development practices.

## Portfolio Demonstration

**Project:** Real-Time Spatial Audio Processing Framework

To demonstrate the quality and depth of services I provide, I have built a complete, production-ready spatial audio processing system. This framework showcases professional-grade infrastructure for audio applications with real-time capabilities and comprehensive testing.

### Core Components

- **STFT Processing Module**: Modular Short-Time Fourier Transform with separate Analysis and Synthesis classes, perfect reconstruction, and configurable overlap ratios (2x, 4x, custom)

- **Spatial Audio System**: HRTF-based binaural rendering for immersive 3D audio with quaternion-based head orientation tracking

- **Real-Time GUI Demo**: Tkinter-based interface with live azimuth/elevation control and per-channel gain management

- **Buffer Management**: Sophisticated input/output buffer handling for seamless streaming audio

- **Activator Pattern**: Abstract base class with both file-based and real-time callback implementations for flexible deployment

- **System Architecture**: Base system class providing module connection and execution framework

### Development Quality

- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100+ tests across all modules using pytest with YAML-based parametrization

- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions with automated testing on all pull requests, branch protection requiring passing tests

- **Modern Development Practices**: Pre-commit hooks, type hints throughout, Python 3.12+, uv package management

- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with multiple interdependent packages in a monorepo structure

- **Production-Ready**: Real-time processing capabilities, perfect reconstruction guarantees, configurable parameters

### Technical Capabilities

- Multiple virtual sound sources at configurable 3D positions (azimuth/elevation)
- Input: CH channels (mono sources) → Output: Binauralized stereo
- Frequency-domain processing with STFT pipeline
- Real-time streaming with PyAudio integration
- File-based processing for offline analysis (.wav, .bin formats)

**Source Code & Documentation:** [github.com/noamshabtai/portfolio](https://github.com/noamshabtai/portfolio)

The complete framework is open-source, demonstrating transparency and code quality. Technical documentation and architecture notes are included in the repository.
